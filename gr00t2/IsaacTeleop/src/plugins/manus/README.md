# Isaac Teleop Device Plugins — Manus

This folder provides a Linux-only example of using the Manus SDK for hand tracking within the Isaac Teleop framework.

## Components

- **Core Library** (`manus_plugin_core`): Interfaces with the Manus SDK (`libIsaacTeleopPluginsManus.so`).
- **Plugin Executable** (`manus_hand_plugin`): The main plugin executable that integrates with the Teleop system.
- **CLI Tool** (`manus_hand_tracker_printer`): A standalone tool to print tracked joint data for verification.

## Prerequisites

- **Linux** (x86_64, tested on Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Manus SDK** for Linux x86_64

## Getting the Manus SDK

The Manus SDK must be downloaded separately due to licensing.

1. Obtain a Manus account and credentials.
2. Download the MANUS Core SDK from [Manus Downloads](https://my.manus-meta.com/resources/downloads).
3. Extract and place the `ManusSDK` folder inside `src/plugins/manus/`, or set the `MANUS_SDK_ROOT` environment variable to your installation path.

Expected layout:
```text
src/plugins/manus/
  app/
    main.cpp
  core/
    manus_hand_tracking_plugin.cpp
  inc/
    core/
      manus_hand_tracking_plugin.hpp
  tools/
    manus_hand_tracker_printer.cpp
  ManusSDK/        <-- Placed here
    include/
    lib/
```

## Build

This plugin is built as part of the Isaac Teleop project. It will be automatically included if the Manus SDK is found.

Run the project build from the repository root:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j
```

If the SDK is not found, the build will skip the Manus plugin with a warning.

## Running the Example

### 1. Verify with CLI Tool
Ensure Manus Core is running and gloves are connected.
Run the printer tool to verify data reception:

```bash
./build/bin/manus_hand_tracker_printer
```

### 2. Run the Plugin
The plugin is installed to the `install` directory.

```bash
./install/plugins/manus/manus_hand_plugin
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Manus SDK not found at build time**: Ensure `ManusSDK` is in `src/plugins/manus/` or `MANUS_SDK_ROOT` is set correctly.
- **Manus SDK not found at runtime**: The build configures RPATH to find the SDK libraries. If you moved the SDK or built without RPATH support, you may need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
- **No data available**: Ensure Manus Core is running and gloves are properly connected and calibrated.

## License

Source files are under their stated licenses. The Manus SDK is proprietary to Manus and is subject to its own license; it is not redistributed by this project.
